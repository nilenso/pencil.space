a queue for processing.\n;; A short time later, the handler registered to handle this event will be run.\n;; What follows is the implementation of this process.\n;;\n;; The task is to process queued events in a perpetual loop, one after\n;; the other, FIFO, calling the registered event-handler for each, being idle when\n;; there are no events, and firing up when one arrives.\n;;\n;; But browsers only have a single thread of control and we must be\n;; careful to not hog the CPU. When processing events one after another, we\n;; must regularly hand back control to the browser, so it can redraw, process\n;; websockets, etc. But not too regularly! If we are in a de-focused browser\n;; tab, our app will be CPU throttled. Each time we get back control, we have\n;; to process all queued events, or else something like a bursty websocket\n;; (producing events) might overwhelm the queue. So there's a balance.\n;;\n;; The processing/handling of an event happens \"asynchronously\" sometime after\n;; that event was enqueued via \"dispatch\". The original implementation of this router loop\n;; used `core.async`. As a result, it was fairly simple, and it mostly worked,\n;; but it did not give enough control. So now we hand-roll our own,\n;; finite-state-machine and all.\n;;\n;; In what follows, the strategy is this:\n;;   - maintain a FIFO queue of `dispatched` events.\n;;   - when a new event arrives, \"schedule\" processing of this queue using\n;;     goog.async.nextTick, which means it will happen \"very soon\".\n;;   - when processing events, one after the other, do ALL the currently\n;;     queued events. Don't stop. Don't yield to the browser. Hog that CPU.\n;;   - but if any new events are dispatched during this cycle of processing,\n;;     don't do them immediately. Leave them queued. Yield first to the browser,\n;;     and do these new events in the next processing cycle. That way we drain\n;;     the queue up to a point, but we never hog the CPU forever. In\n;;     particular, we handle the case where handling one event will beget\n;;     another event. The freshly begotten event will be handled next cycle,\n;;     with yielding in-between.\n;;   - In some cases, an event should not be handled until after the GUI has been\n;;     updated, i.e., after the next Reagent animation frame. In such a case,\n;;     the event should be dispatched with :flush-dom metadata like this:\n;;       (dispatch ^:flush-dom [:event-id other params])\n;;     Such an event will temporarily block all further processing because\n;;     events are processed sequentially: we handle one event completely\n;;     before we handle the ones behind it.\n;;\n;; Implementation notes:\n;;   - queue processing can be in a number of states: scheduled, running, paused\n;;     etc. So it is modeled as a Finite State Machine.\n;;     See \"-fsm-trigger\" (below) for the states and transitions.\n;;   - the scheduling is done via \"goog.async.nextTick\" which is pretty quick\n;;   - when the event has :flush-dom metadata we schedule via\n;;       \"reagent.core.after-render\"\n;;     which will run event processing after the next Reagent animation frame.\n;;\n\n;; Events can have metadata which says to pause event processing.\n;; event metadata -> \"run later\" functions\n(def later-fns\n  {:flush-dom (fn [f] (after-render #(next-tick f)))   ;; one tick after the end of the next annimation frame\n   :yield     next-tick})               ;; almost immediately\n\n\n;; Event Queue Abstraction\n(defprotocol IEventQueue\n\n  ;; -- API\n  (push [this event])\n  (add-post-event-callback [this id callack])\n  (remove-post-event-callback [this f])\n  (purge [this])\n\n  ;; -- Implementation via a Finite State Machine\n  (-fsm-trigger [this trigger arg])\n\n  ;; -- Finite State Machine actions\n  (-add-event [this event])\n  (-process-1st-event-in-queue [this])\n  (-run-next-tick [this])\n  (-run-queue [this])\n  (-exception [this ex])\n  (-pause [this later-fn])\n  (-resume [this])\n  (-call-post-event-callbacks [this event]))\n\n\n;; Concrete implementation of IEventQueue\n(deftype EventQueue [#?(:cljs ^:mutable fsm-state               :clj ^:volatile-mutable fsm-state)\n                     #?(:cljs ^:mutable queue                   :clj ^:volatile-mutable queue)\n                     #?(:cljs ^:mutable post-event-callback-fns :clj ^:volatile-mutable post-event-callback-fns)]\n  IEventQueue\n\n  ;; -- API ------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  (push [this event]         ;; presumably called by dispatch\n    (-fsm-trigger this :add-event event))\n\n  ;; register a callback function which will be called after each event is processed\n  (add-post-event-callback [_ id callback-fn]\n    (if (contains?
